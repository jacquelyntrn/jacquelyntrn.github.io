I believe the biggest learning curve would be Browser History 1 because it was the basis for the rest of the WODs. I had to watch the screencast pretty carefully. It was also our first WOD for the class. Getting the background photo to fit into the border was the only hinderence. The secnd WODs introduced style sheets, but style sheets were a little easier to use. They seemed less technical and more understandable for changing the lay out of our webpage. My approach to the WOD was watching the screencast and doing it on my own at first. Then, right after I would clear my work and try to record what I did. It went well like that for most of the WODs. There were only sometimes that I would forget somethings that I could go the first time because it was cleared. I didn't forget with the video because I was keeping up with it. However, repeating recording when I forget something helped me remember and cut down time.
