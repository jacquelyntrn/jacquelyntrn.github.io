<b>Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details.</b>

<b>Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.</b>
<p>
I believe the most difficult part to this WOD was the formatting of what the chart looks like. This was done in the second half of the code. It seemed like something simple to have a table with the items in listed in it, but all the names had to be indivually formatted and positioned. It was more challenging because it was done in Javascript. 
</p>

<p>
What worked best for me was understanding the math and logistics in how the invoice works. It was all labelled and tagged so it was clear to understand. Learning the single line comments also helped keep everything well organized. It also helped to duplicate the first code for the product and then change it for each product.                                                               
</p>

<b>Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?</b>
<p>
For this WOD, I watched the screencast and completed the WOD without recording. However, there was a lot to remember and complete in this lab, so I had a seperate place to keep record of code that I had already done. If I needed to copy and paste, then I could have it available. It especailly helped with the script because I was less familiar with the formatting. I could forget what certain tags mean or accidently leave out some $. 
</p>

<b>Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.</b>
<p>
I think what I would want to do most is only code one product and then do the table and math. I would make sure just that one code works. Then, I could replicate that to the rest without worry that it might not work. It's easier to keep track of then doing the name, replicating, or doing the table, replicating. So I would do the WOD in the order of do the name and table of one item and then replicate everything.
