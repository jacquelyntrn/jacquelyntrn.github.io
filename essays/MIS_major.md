I first took ICS 111 as I thought I was interested in computer science, being that I spend a lot of time on my computer. I also recognized the direction of the future job market leaning towards being more technology-based. Rather than work a job that will be replaced by computers, I would want to work a job that works with computers. However, I quickly learned that ICS 111 was not the class for me. Although it was really similar to ITM 352, where you'll be able to learn beginner coding, I realized the computer science major was more about making the software and websites. I understood that MIS was more about how to use software and websites in a way that is more practical to business.

In addition to MIS being a major I had interest in, MIS also paired well with my other major, Accounting. I learned from many of my peers that Accounting and MIS are common to double major in and would be really helpful for the future. I'm looking forward to this class to better understand all the ins and outs of coding.
